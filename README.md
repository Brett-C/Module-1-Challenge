# Module-1-Challenge
Challenge from module 1

## Description
In this module we were asked to look at the code and get it into semantic form. The code started using loads of "div" elements to break up the sections. By using the semantic elements, we are able to tell developers what content is, and what should go in it. For example, the element "header" refers to the top of the page. By swapping out the div elements, we also needed to update the stylesheet in css so that the styles remained the same to the original code.
